> Choose your leaders with wisdom and forethought.  
> To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears.  
> To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool.  
> To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen.  
> To be led by a liar is to ask to be told lies.  
> To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.
